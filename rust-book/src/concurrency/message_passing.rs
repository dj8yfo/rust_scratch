//! Rust book: <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-02-message-passing.html>
//!
//! In a way, channels in any programming language are similar to single ownership, because once you
//! transfer a value down a channel, you can no longer use that value.
//!
//! You can move messages between threads. The messages are sent using channels. Messages are values
//! that are in memory.
//! 1. Each message is moved when sent.
//! 2. Then it is moved again when received.
//! 3. There can be many senders, but only one receiver.
//!
//! In contrast, shared memory concurrency is like multiple ownership: multiple threads can access
//! the same memory location at the same time.
