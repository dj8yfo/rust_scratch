▶PENDING:
  styling for layout engine:
    ✔ create style struct @done(22-05-20 19:06)
    ✔ impl lazy eval macro (in r3bl_rs_utils), and use it in Style @done(22-05-21 10:40)
    ✔ impl lazy executor trait for r3bl_rs_utils @done(22-05-21 10:40)
    ✔ concept of styling for layout (padding, fg color, bg color, focus highlight) @done(22-05-21 10:44)
  ☐ stylesheets
      ☐ extend style to have an id field
      ☐ create a stylesheet struct
      ☐ attach it to canvas
      ☐ extend layout to have style id
  ☐ layout & position w/ styling support
    ☐ attach style to canvas & figure out positioning of layouts w/ padding
  ☐ figure out how to accomodate focus management
    ☐ extend canvas to have a focus field (current id w/ focus)
    ☐ how does this affect rendering of a layout (paint focus highlight?)

  crossterm integration:
    ☐ just crossterm: https://tinyurl.com/y5je8mvr
    ☐ w/ tui: https://tinyurl.com/y56m5jgl
    ☐ emit crossterm commands from `canvas.rs`
    ☐ figure out how to use crossterm
    ☐ emit crossterm commands from `canvas.rs`
    ☐ write test for `canvas.rs` to ensure it emits crossterm commands correctly

  focus mgmt:
    ☐ key input processing & state mgmt (redux?)

  build app:
    ☐ create a 2 col layout TUI app using crossterm & layout engine
    ☐ write tests and add layout engine supports debug output in TUI
